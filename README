 DESCRIPTION
 -----------
    Inodeum (Internode Usage Monitor) is an application designed to view 
    ISP usage data plus more for Internode Linux users.

 INSTALL
 -------

 1. DISTRIBUTION PACKAGE
 -----------------------
    This is probably the easiest and best way for installation.

    Download the latest distribution archive from here: 
    	https://github.com/mr-headwind/Inodeum/tree/master/DIST_PACKAGES 
    to your download directory (eg. $HOME/Downloads).

    Start a terminal or xterm session
    cd $HOME/Downloads (or your download directory)
    tar xvzf inodeum-x.xx.tar.gz (where x.xx is the version number)
    ./configure --prefix=/usr
    make
    sudo make install

    The following sections may help if you encounter problems during this process.

 2. DEB PACKAGE
 --------------
    A binary deb package file is available on SourceForge at:-

	https://sourceforge.net/projects/inodeum/?source=directory

    or go to the SourceForge home page and search for 'inodeum'.

    Download the binary for your environment to your preferred download directory.
    Both 64 and 32 bit binaries are provided.
    Install the package using your preferred package manager / installer. 
        eg. sudo gdebi inodeum-n.nn_amd64.deb   (you may need:  'sudo apt install gdebi-core' first)
        or  sudo dpkg -i inodeum-n.nn_amd64.deb   followed by  'sudo apt-get install -f'

 DEPENDENCIES
 ------------
    The GTK+ 3.0 libraries need to be installed and, for the most part,
    will likely already be present. However, if there is a problem, try:
    	sudo apt-get build-dep libgtk-3-dev 
	sudo apt-get update
    
    Additionally the following libraries are required and _MAY_ need installation if 
    dependencies cannot be resolved on installation:-
    	gnome-keyring, ssl, crypto, pthread, pcap.

    Depending on how installation is done, the following may me required if dependency
    problems persist:-
    	sudo apt-get install libgnome-keyring-dev*
    	sudo apt-get install libpthread-stubs0-dev
    	sudo apt-get install libcairo2-dev
    	sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
    	sudo apt-get install libpcap-dev  ????
